# Distributed greeter tasks

- (POSTPONED) Use refresh tokens
  - Needs too much work on the UI side
- (DONE) Fix UI to use the new tokens/rest endpoints
- Use DB for users in login service
- (DONE) Use GIN for the REST layer
- Extract the jwt auth as a shared module
- Store jwt tokens in a cookie
  - Will change how /greet works
  - Will change how /login, /logout works
    - How to communicate back to the browser the cookie is invalid?
- Add "favorite language" to greeter
- (DONE) Add "delete user" and "get user details" to login service
- Add messaging communication to greeter to sync state
  - Portable protocol: AMQP (supported by AWS and Azure services)
  - Quick solution:
    - KubeMQ?
    - Redis?
  - Event Log (e.g. Kafka)
    - Likely not needed
  - *Q*: Guarantee that events are not missed
    - When is a pub/sub topic cleared of stored events? (so that a service can re-boot and re-consume them)
    - Perhaps Kafka is needed after all?
- Add UI for login service to list and delete users
- Add readiness probes
  - Ready once Redis is available
- Add some debug logs: Gin logs the requests, but there's need of more
  - How to mix the Gin logs which are structured in a particular way with my logs?
